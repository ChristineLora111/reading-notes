[Go back to Reading Notes home](README.md)

<b>Introduction Summary: (pg. 2-11)</b>
How people access the web:
- They do it through <i>browsers, web servers, devices and screen readers.</i>
- <b>BROWSERS:</b> It's a software. Popular examples include FireFox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome & Opera.
- <b>WEB SERVERS:</b> Users ask the browser for a web page. The request is sent across the internet to a special computer called a web server, 
which hosts the website.
- <b>DEVICES:</b>: These include desktop computers, laptops, tablets, & mobile phones.
- <b>SCREEN READERS:</b> Programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user.

All websites use HTML and CSS. However, content management systems, blogging software and e-commerce platforms can be more complex and have more technology to them.

<b>HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” Summary: (pg.12-39)</b>
- HTML pages are text documents
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angles brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as ELEMENTS.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content. The closing tag denotes the end. 
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element. Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML, you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

<b>HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” Summary: (pg.176-199)</b>
- D0CTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you're using.
- You can add comments to your code between the < !-- and -- >) markers.
- The id an class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
- The < div > and < span > elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- < iframes > cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- The < meta > tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and C.

<b>HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” Summary: (pg.428-451)</b>
- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple < div > elements)
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed. Available for free on Google.

<b>HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” Summary: (pg.452-475)</b>
- It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.


## Reading Notes from the Duckett JS book:

<b>JS Chapter 1: “The ABC of Programming” Summary: (pg.11-52)</b>

<p> How would you write a script for a web page? </p>
- It's best to keep JavaScript code in it's own JavaScript file. 
- JavaScript files are text files like HTML pages and CSS style sheets, but they have the .js extention
- The HTML < script > element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file, kinda like the < link > element 
can be used to load a CSS file.
- If you view the source code of the page in the brower, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script work with the model
of the web page that the browser has created.
