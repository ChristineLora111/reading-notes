How people access the web:
- They do it through <i>browsers, web servers, devices and screen readers.</i>
- <b>BROWSERS:</b> It's a software. Popular examples include FireFox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome & Opera.
- <b>WEB SERVERS:</b> Users ask the browser for a web page. The request is sent across the internet to a special computer called a web server, 
which hosts the website.
- <b>DEVICES:</b>: These include desktop computers, laptops, tablets, & mobile phones.
- <b>SCREEN READERS:</b> Programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user.

All websites use HTML and CSS. However, content management systems, blogging software and e-commerce platforms can be more complex and have more technology to them.

<b>HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” Summary: (pg.12-39)</b>

- HTML pages are text documents
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angles brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as ELEMENTS.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content. The closing tag denotes the end. 
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element. Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML, you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

<b>HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” Summary: (pg.428-451)</b>

- HTML5 is an upgraded version of HTML. It's elements can indicate the purpose of different portions of a web page and it can also help to describe its structure.

- There are older browsers that don't understand HTML5 elements, in which it needs to be told which elements are block level elements.
- To make HTML5 work on IE 8 and older versions, extra Javascript is needed. Luckily, this is available for free on Google.

<b>HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” Summary: (pg.452-475)</b>

- Site maps help you plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes: They organize the information that will need to go on each page.
- Design is another form of communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors get an understanding of what you're trying to tell them, without really telling them.
- You can differentiate pieces of information using size, color and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

<b>JS Chapter 1: “The ABC of Programming” Summary: (pg.11-52)</b>

<p>How would you write a script for a web page?</p>

- It's always good to keep JavaScript code in it's own separate JavaScript file. 
- JavaScript files are text files similar to HTML pages and CSS style sheets, but they have the .js at the end 
- The HTML < script > element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file. If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript doesn't change the HTML associated with it. The Java scripting works with the model of the web page that the browser created
