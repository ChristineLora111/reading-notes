< div > elements:
- Often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

Normal Flow Display Page:
- Browsers typically display pages in normal flow by default unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

Float Property:
- It moves content to the left or right of a page.
- It can be used to create multi-column layouts.
- Items using float require a defined width.

Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide.
They also indicate what the purpose of the site and what it's about within the top 600 pixels.
- This is to demonstrate its relevence without scrolling.

Grids:
- They help create professional and flexible designs.
- They set consistent proportions and spaces between items.
- Creates a continuity between different pages, where you can use different designs.
- Makes it easier to add new content to the site in a consistent way.
- Helps with collaboration on the design of the site

CSS Frameworks:
- Provide rules for common tasks such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages, etc.
- You can include the CSS framework code in your projects, rather than writing the CSS from scratch.

There can be multiple CSS files in one page
